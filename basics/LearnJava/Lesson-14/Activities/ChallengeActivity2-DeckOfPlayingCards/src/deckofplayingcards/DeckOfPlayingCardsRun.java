/** Challenge Activity 2 - A Deck of Playing Cards
 * 
 * In this activity we will implement a class to satisfy a deck of cards
 * 
 * In Deck.java you'll implement all the methods with TODO sections.
 * 
 *  Then write a main() program to accomplish the following
 *      - print the random number seed
 *      - create a new deck of cards (one deck) with seed as random number seed
 *      - print the new deck of cards (unshuffled)
 *      - shuffle the deck
 *      - print the deck again (now its shuffled)
 *      - deal 1 cards into a variable
 *      - print the deck  (now there's one less card)
 *      - return the card to the deck
 *      - print the deck again (52 card again returned card is at the end of the deck)
 
 * PROGRAM OUTPUT:

Random number seed : 44
Deck(52) : 2♣ 3♣ 4♣ 5♣ 6♣ 7♣ 8♣ 9♣ T♣ J♣ Q♣ K♣ A♣ 2♦ 3♦ 4♦ 5♦ 6♦ 7♦ 8♦ 9♦ T♦ J♦ Q♦ K♦ A♦ 2♥ 3♥ 4♥ 5♥ 6♥ 7♥ 8♥ 9♥ T♥ J♥ Q♥ K♥ A♥ 2♠ 3♠ 4♠ 5♠ 6♠ 7♠ 8♠ 9♠ T♠ J♠ Q♠ K♠ A♠

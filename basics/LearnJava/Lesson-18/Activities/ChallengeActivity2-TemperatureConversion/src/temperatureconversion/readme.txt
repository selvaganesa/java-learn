/** Challenge Activity 2 - Temperature Conversion
 * 
 * In this activity, we will write a GUI program to convert temperatures to/from 
 * Celcius/Fahrenheit. You should be able to run the program right now but it will
 * not perform the conversion. Your mission for this activity it to get the 
 * program to perform the conversions and display the correct temperature when
 * the button is pressed.
 * 
 * NOTE: you should be able to find the formulas for conversion from C -> F
 * and F-> C on-line. 
 *
 * The form has been setup, all you need to do is write the code.

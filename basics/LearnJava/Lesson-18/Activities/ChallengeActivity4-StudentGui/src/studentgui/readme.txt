Challenge Activity 3 - Loading and Saving Student data from the GUI.

In this Activity you will complete the code for this GUI program which allows
you to enter student data and then save it to a file. You can also load data from 
a saved student file back off of disk and into the form. 

Most of the code has been written for you, and you only need to complete the
sections commented with TODO in the StudentGUI.java file.

I strongly recommend opening the solution and running it so you can get a feel
for how this program works. And remember - no peeking at the code!!!

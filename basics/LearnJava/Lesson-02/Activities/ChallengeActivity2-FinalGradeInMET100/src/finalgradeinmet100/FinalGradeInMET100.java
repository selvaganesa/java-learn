/* Challenge Activity 2
 * 
 * When I was in college my MET100 Professor only gave us 3 exams. 
 * There were 150 questions on each exam. 
 * Your final grade in the course was the sum of the number of questions
 * you got right on each of exam1, exam2 and exam3 divided by 450 (the 
 * maximum possible points) 
 * 
 * Write a program which given 3 exam scores displays your total of all 3
 * exam scores and percentage (as a whole number) 
 * 
 * SAMPLE RUN: 
 *  Exam 1 Score : 120
 *  Exam 2 Score : 135
 *  Exam 3 Score : 130
 *  Total points : 385
 *  Percentage : 85

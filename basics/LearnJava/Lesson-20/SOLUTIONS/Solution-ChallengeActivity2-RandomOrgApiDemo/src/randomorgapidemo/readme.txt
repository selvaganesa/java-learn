/*
 * Challenge Activity 2 - Getting True Random numbers with the Random.Org API
 * 
 * In this challenge activity, We'll write a GUI which asks for two integers.
 * It in turn delivers a random number between those two integers using the 
 * Random.org Web API whenever the button is clicked.
 * 
 * Specifically, you should call the getRandomNumberBetween() method 
 * of the RandomOrgApi class to retrieve the random number.
 * 
 * Remeber GUI controls (Text Boxes) contain strings but the API requires ints
 * so you will need to parse the string to an int, then convert the int back
 * to a string to display it. 
 * 
 * Catch any exception thrown and display it in a messagebox.
 * 
 * PROGRAM OUTPUT:
 * Take a look at screenshot.jpg in the project folder. For which controls you
 * need to add to the form to complete this program.
 * 
 * I also suggest opening the solution and running it so you can get a feel for
 * the behavior of the program.

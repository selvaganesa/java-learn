/* Challenge Acticity 3 - Playing Cards Example
 * 
In this activity you will experience the true value of unit tests:
How can you verify the code you've written is correct?

Your goal is to complete the following methods inside Card.Java:
    isBlack() - returns true when this card is black (clubs or spades)
    isFace() - returns true when this card is a face card (jack, queen or king)
    sameColor(Card c) - returns true when this card is is the same color as Card c

But how will you know those methods are correct? Up to this point we would have to 
write a main() method to test it but now we will write unit tests instead.

This lesson also introduces code coverage. Writing enough tests to ensure your code
is correct. For example since both clubs are spades are black cards you need 2 test
methods - one for each case.

INSTRUCTIONS: 
1) setup the //arrange portion of the test in CardTest.java so they make sense.
2) run the tests - isBlack(), isFace(), and sameColor() tests will 
   fail because because the methods in Card.java have not been implemented.
3) complete the code in Card.java, run the tests to ensure the code is correct.
4) When all the test pass, you can be reasonably confident your code is correct!

What does it take to be 100% confident your code is correct?

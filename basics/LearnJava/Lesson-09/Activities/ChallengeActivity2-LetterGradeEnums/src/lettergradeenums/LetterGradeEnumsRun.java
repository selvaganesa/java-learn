/** Challenge Activity 2 - Letter Grades with Enumerations
 * 
 * Solve the same problem as the previous challenge activity, but
 * this time use the custom java Enum in the Grade.java so rather than writing:
 * 
 *         if (finalGrade >=90) {
 *           finalLetter = "A";
 *         }
 * 
 *  You'll use this more readable version with enums:
 * 
 *         if (finalGrade >=Grade.A.Min()) {
 *            finalLetter = Grade.A;
 *       }
 * 
 * Same input and output as before:
 
 * PROGRAM OUTPUT SAMPLES:
 *  Enter your final average [0-100] : 67.8
 *  A final average of 67.800000 translates to a letter grade of D
 * 
 *  Enter your final average [0-100] : 90.0
 *  A final average of 90.000000 translates to a letter grade of A
 * 
 * Enter your final average [0-100] : 89.999999
 * A final average of 89.999999 translates to a letter grade of B

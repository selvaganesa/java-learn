/** Challenge Activity 3 - Sorting Cards in your Hand
 * 
 * In this activity, we will write code to deal out 2 seven-card hands from
 * 1 deck of shuffled cards. You will then sort those hands by rank, then suit.
 * 
 * Inside Hand.java, implement the following methods.
 * - sortSuitFirst() sorts the hand by suit then rank (similar to the method in Deck.java)
 * - sortRankFirst() sorts the hand by rank then suit.
 * Note: In both cases you should use a comparator with Collections.sort easy.
 * 
 * Inside this file, write a main() method to
 *  use 1 deck of cards, 
 *  shuffle that deck, 
 *  deal 7 cards each into two hand (hint: use a loop, alternate cards to each hand)
 *  show hand 1
 *  sort hand 1 by rank
 *  sort hand 1 by suit
 *  show hand 2
 *  sort hand 2 by rank
 *  sort hand 2 by suit
 * 
 * PROGRAM OUTPUT: (for 1 deck of cards, random number seed 15)

/**
 * Given a collection of equality constraints of the form xi = xj, and inequality constraints of the form xi != xj, is it possible to satisfy all the
 * constraints simultaneously? For example, the constraints x1 = x2, x2 = x3, x3 = x4, and x1 != x4 cannot be satisfied simultaneously. Such
 * constraints arise in checking the equivalence of loop-free programs with uninterpreted functions.
 * 
 * <br>
 * The interview questions to this description is as following: "Design an efficient algorithm that takes as input a collection of equality and
 * inequality constraints and decides whether the constraints can be satisfied simultaneously."

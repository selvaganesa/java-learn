Algorithms & Interview Questions
================================

This repository contains:
- Common Algorithms that were implemented using Java
- Solutions to a lot of interview questions

Graph Algorithms & Solutions:
-----------------------------
- Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm
- Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm
- Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for directed graphs with non-negative weights
- Algorithm that solves the max-spacing k clustering problem: "Given a distance measure d and k, compute the k-clustering with maximum spacing"
- Algorithm that solves the interview question: "Design an efficient algorithm that takes as input a collection of equality and 
inequality constraints and decides whether the constraints can be satisfied simultaneously."
- Algorithm based on DFS that allows to iterate over a directed graph in different orders (preorder, postorder, reverse postorder)
- Algorithm based on DFS to determine whether a directed graph contains a cycle. It also returns the entire path from source vertex to the cycle end
- Algorithm to compute the topological ordering of a directed graph that is also a DAG
- Algorithm that solves the "All-Pair-Shortest Path Problem"


Sorting:
--------
- Mergesort (with multiple improvements)
- Quicksort (with multiple improvements)
- Calculating the number of inversions
- Merging k sorted arrays in an efficient manner.

Stacks:
------
- An implementation to translate infix to postfix expressions
- An algorithm that checks whether a given string contains properly nested and balanced parentheses
- An algorithm that reverses a stack without using additional data structures. Interview question: "Reverse a stack without using extra space (recursion can be used)."
- Stack Sorter. Interview question "Sort a stack of numbers in descending order"

Some general algorithms and/or solutions:
-------------------------------------------
- Knapsack problem
- Finding a missing integer. Interview question: "Given an input file with four billion non-negative integers, provide an algorithm to generate an integer which is not contained in the file.<br> Assume that you have 1GB of memory available for this task."
- Computing largest sums
- Two-Sum and Three-Sum solver
- Levenshtein Distance
- An algorithm that checks whether a string is a palindrome
- An algorithm that computes the square root based on the binary search approach
- Different algorithms and approaches were implemented to generate all permutations of a given string
- and many more...

Searching:
---------------------
- Different solutions to interview questions that relate to searching, such as
